## .env

The `.env` file is used to store environment variables for the project. These variables are used to configure the
application and contain sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and other credentials.

Please note that the `.env` file should never be committed to version control, as it contains sensitive information that
should not be shared publicly. Instead, you should add the `.env` file to your .gitignore file to ensure that it is not
accidentally committed.

To use the application, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary
environment variables. You can refer to the above file for an example of the required variables and their format.

***The values provided in the
instructions are for demonstration purposes only and will not work as-is. You will need to replace them with actual
values that are specific to your environment.***
